This project will analyze and try to find if there is a relationship between rates of living alone and mental health/addiction-related hospital admission rates in Toronto communities

Hypothesis: elevated rates of living alone in communities lead to a higher prevalence of mental health-related hospitalization

In this, I use 2016 Toronto census data on hospital admissions and Toronto census data on housing conditions

In terms of methods that will be used to support the hypothesis, regression tables, regression equations, confidence intervals, and null hypotheses will all be employed

the simple regression will inspect the correlation between the 2 variables

null hypothesis: a 95% confidence interval will be created of the difference in the mean between 2 variables. If zero is not on the interval then the null hypothesis will be rejected

Here is the table of contents that goes through my steps in the project

Step 1. Project aim and variables used

Step 2. Cleaning the data to make it easier to use for analysis

Step 3. Statistical summary and Histogram of employed variables

Step 4: Scatterplot, simple regression, and regression equation

Step 5. testing the null hypothesis: communities with above-average rates of living alone vs below-average

Step 6. Conclusion and limitations: the association between housing type and mental health/addiction-related hospital admissions.
