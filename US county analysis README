This project will analyze and try to find if there is a correlation between population density and community health in US counties. 
In particular, community health will be measured using county data on several variables, which include the % of residents with fair or poor health, 
the average number of mentally unhealthy days, the average number of physically unhealthy days, % of adults with diabets, and the suicide rate. 
These variables balance between mental and physical health indicators, as both are important to overall community wellbeing. 

The data used in my analysis come from John Davisâ€™s dataset, a Biomechanics PhD Student at Indiana University, which gathered weather, health, and socioeconomic data 
from 3142 US counties in 2020 to identify the most COVID-vulnerable communities in the country.
