    "    \n",
    "This project will analyze and try to find if there is a relationship between rates of living alone and mental health/addiction related hospital admission rates in Toronto communities. As such, I will be using Toronto census data on hospital admissions in 2016 and Toronto census data on housing conditons (living alone) in 2016. The hypothesis which this analysis hopes to inform states that elevated rates of living alone in communities leads to a higher prevalence of mental health related hospitalization. The reasoning behind this supposed relationship relies on the assumption that loneliness is a strong driver of poor mental health outcome due to the isolation/lack of companionship it entails. It has often been said that humans are social creatures so it would only make sense that reduced rates of social interaction as a result of living conditions would impact mental health negatively. In terms of methods that will be used to support the hypothesis, regression tables, regression equations, confidence intervals, and null hypotheses will all be employed.\n",

    "The living alone rate will be measured using Toronto census data (2016) on residents living alone. The variables of interest in this dataset are named 'TOTAL POPULATION in PRIVATE HOUSEHOLDS LIVING ALONE' and 'TOTAL POPULATION in PRIVATE HOUSEHOLDS'. By dividing these 2 variables, I derive my x-variable for the analysis which measures the percent of residents among all private households in a community that live alone. The value of this variable is straightforward in that it reflects the likelihood of living alone, percent wise, among private households in different Toronto communities. "

    " The response variable in this analysis is taken from the Toronto census dataset on mental health and addiction related hospital admission (2016). It measures the amount of mental health or addiction related hospital admissions in a Toronto community for every 1000 people over 15 years of age. Hospital admission rates on the basis of mental health would be a good indicator of mental health outcomes as hospital admissions are usually serious making it more reliable than self-reported data while also being, as is stated in the variables name, a direct measure of mental health."

Since the original data for hospital admissions has both columns and sub-columns, the order of columns gets confused and many columns are renamed to 'unnamed: #'. Firstly, going back to my excel data set, I am interested in the columns that contain the average annual rate of Mental Health and Addiction-related Hospitalizations for both sexes ages 15+. So I select the columns 'Unnamed: 0', 'Unnamed: 1', and 'Both sexes.3'. The first 2 correspond to the neighborhood names and neighborhood ID, while the last corresponds to the average annual rate I am looking for. "

This would naturally be the case since if a community has, for instance, twice the popualtion of another it would have probably more people living alone. To avoid such a dependency on population count, I create a new variable which tracks the rate of people living alone from the total population of private households. I do this by simply dividing the total living alone in private households per community by said communities total private household populations. This value will tell me the percent of people in private households in each community that live alone."

    "Above is a statistical summary of the distribution of the response variable. The count indicates that there are 142 different data points or 142 different Toronto communities that are accounted for. The mean of 5.673 means that among all the communities in Toronto for every 1000 people over age 15, there are on average close to 6 people who have a mental health/addiction related hospital admission. The standard deviations tells us how spread out the values for our variable are from the mean. A standard deviation of 2.77 is fairly large in this case as it is nearly half the size of the variables mean. The minimum value communicates that the lowest amount of mental health/addic hospital admissions among all the Toronto communities was 1.9 people per 1000. The 25th percentile means that communities with 4.2 hospital admissions per 1000 were in the bottom 25% of communities. The same logic in interpretation follows for the next 2 percentiles. The maximum value communicates that the highest amount of mental health/addic hospital admissions from all the Toronto communities was 22.2 people per 1000"

    "The histogram above represents the distribution of the explanatory variable: living alone rates among pivate households in Toronto communities in other words. The y-axis tracks the density of our x-values so the height of the bars represent the percent of the total that they account for. As can be seen, almost all of the data falls between 3% to 30% living alone among private households, with the bulk of the data being between 10% and 30%. It is also shown that the median of the data is around 20% which matches the 50th percentile value of our statistical summary for our explanatory variable. There are data point however that stretch thinnly all the way to around 55% which indicates, along with the fact that most of our data falls between 10% to 30%, that the distribution is somewhat rightly skewed.

    "The histogram above represents the distribution of the response variable: Mental health and addiction related hospital admission rates. The y-axis tracks the density of the rates, in other words, what percent of the data on hospitalization rates falls under each x-axes value. As can be seen, almost all of the data falls between 2.5 to 10 hospital admissions per 1000 people, with the bulk of the data being between 2.5 and 7.5 admissions per 1000. It is also shown that the median of the data is close to 5 or 6 which matches our statistical summary table. There are data points however that stretch thinnly all the way to 22 which indicates, along with the fact that most of our data falls between 2.5-7.5, that the distribution is right skewed. "

For now though, I will continue to investigate if this positive relationship holds when using other statistical methods"

To determine the average, I will rely on the 50th percenntile value provided by the statistical summary of the living alone rate variable in step 3. I use the median rather than the mean because as determined by our histogram plot of the variables distribution, it is somewhat right skewed. Skew takes away from the accuracy of mean measure whereas median measure is more resistant to such."

On the other hand, in communities with above average living alone rates, there are on average 6.38 people admitted into hospital for mental health reasons. This represents a mean difference of 1.42 people per 1000 between the 2 categories.

    "In the cell above, I created a histogram to better visualize the distribution of the values in my list bootstrap_means. So the graph above plots the distribution of the difference in the means between the above average living alone rate communities and the below average living alone rate communities. What can be seen is that from the 5000 samples of size 50 taken from our original dataset, the bulk of mean differences tended to fall around ~1-2. So the median difference between Toronto communities with above average living alone rates vs below average, is somewhere between 1 and 2 people per 1000 based on a sample size of 5000. At times, the difference could be as high as ~4.5 people per 1000 or as small as ~ -0.5 people per 1000. The latter actually indicates that in a few of the 5000 samples, communities with below average living alone rates had a higher mean mental health hospital admission rate, hence why the difference is negative."

    "It was stated in the Null hypothesis that there is no difference in the average mental health hospital admission rate between Toronto communities with and without above average rates of living alone among private households. According to our 95% confidence interval though this does not seem to be the case. With a sample size of 5000, I can say with 95% confidence that the mean difference in mental health related hopsital admission rates between Toronto communities with above average living alone rates vs below average falls between ~0.06 people per 1000 and ~3.017 people per 1000. Since zero, or a mean difference of zero, is not on this interval, I can reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis. So according to our Alternative hypothesis, it is again the case that Toronto communities with above average rates of living alone among private households have higher rates of mental health related hospital admissions. \n"

    "Retouch below again on the three methods used to explore the relationship between the 2 variables: Toronto communities' mental health and addiction related hospital admission rates vs living alone rates among private households in these communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "simple regression: I determined according to this method that there was a strongly positve relationship between living alone rates among private households and the rate of mental health related hospital admission in said community. This was understood through the large positive slope for the regression equation and positvely sloping line of best fit for the scatterplot measuring correlation between living alone rates for private households and mental health hospitalization rate among Toronto communities in 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation of Coefficient (R^2): I determined according to this method that there was a modest level of explanation of the response variable by the explanatory variable, considering the context of the data (i.e, the data is observatory and not controlled for). \n",
    "\n",
    "Null hypothesis: It was stated in the Null hypothesis that there is no difference in the average mental health hospital admission rate between Toronto communities with and without above average rates of living alone among private households. According to the 95% confidence based on 5000 samples of size 50 communities, I determined that this was not the case. Judging from the interval, I was able to determine with 95% confidence that, in this context, there was a difference in the mean mental health hospitalization rates between Toronto communities with above and below average rates of living alone. Thus, the Null hypothesis was rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis; that there is a difference between the 2 groups. "

    "##### Practical Significance and overall interpretation of my results\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of my analysis make logical sense. Humans are by their nature social creatures. They rely on others to care for them physically and as an outlet for emotional aspects of character. Living alone then, more often than not, entails several difficulties. You have no one to talk to when you come home from work. You have no one to help you when sick, in physical pain, or tired. Generally, as well, self-esteem may be impacted as you see others having company but yourself being alone. This is just my own specualtion however, based on snippets of information, experiences, and words I have collected in my mind over the years. To determine if my thinking is based in reality though, I will cite some sources that back my claims.\n",

    "Source 1: National library of Medicine. In an article titled, 'The Loneliness–Life Satisfaction Relationship', the article presents a comprehensive study investigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological well-being, with a specific focus on loneliness, hopelessness, depression, ego-resilience, and life satisfaction among university students in South Africa during the national lockdown from March to June 2020. one of the key takeways is that loneliness, exacerbated by social distancing and lockdown measures, was identified as a significant predictor of depression, hopelessness, and reduced life satisfaction. Further, the study finds that these variables influence eachother in very complex ways with, for instance,  loneliness leading to hopelessness, which in turn leads to depression. All this, indicates causation between living alone and mental health outcomes (i.e, increased incidene of depression). However, the study, while insightful, was cross-sectional and relied on self-reported data, which potentially introduces bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Source 2: Frontiers in Psychiatry. In an article titled, 'Assessment of the relationship between living alone and the risk of depression based...', researchers found that individuals living alone have a 42% increased risk of developing depression compared to those who do not live alone. This finding is consistent with the source 1 cross-sectional study but is now supported by longitudinal data, suggesting a stronger evidence base for this association. The review included seven studies, encompassing six cohort studies and one case-control study, with a total of 123,859 participants, the majority of whom were females (65.3%). The analysis also used a random-effects model to account for the heterogeneity across studies. The article acknowledges several limitations, including the small number of longitudinal studies available but overall it presents a more convincing argument to the hypothesis that living alone causes deteriorated mental health and so higher incidence of mental health related hospital admission. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, overall, it seems logical to conclude that living alone leads to poorer mental health and, as a result, a higher incidence of mental health related hospital admission."

    "Causality vs. Correlation: In the context of this analysis, the data is observatory and neither variable is controlled for. If it was the case that the variables were controlled for in a strictly designed experiment then I could accept, with a high degree of sureness that higher rates of living alone cause higher rates of mental health related hospitalization. However due to the nature of our data, it cannot be said with sureness whether higher living alone rates are causing higher rates of mental health related hospitalization or if there is simply just a correlation. So I think that it is best to conclude that there is certainly correlation between our variables, and from our other statistical analyses methods, there is modest reason to believe that there is causation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Confouding variables: Confounding variables are the unseen factors that could be influencing both my variables. In the case of my data, one important confounding variable may be the age distribution of a community. Communities with a higher proportion of elderly people would perhaps have higher rates of living alone due to, for instance, widowhood. Older people due to savings, cheaper mortgage rates in the past, etc would also be more likely to own private households in Toronto as opposed to their younger countrparts who face higher housing costs and have had less time to save. So, in theory, if old people make up the bulk of private household ownership then it is possible that they live alone due to things like widowhood whilst also experiencing deteriorated mental health due to the multitude difficulties that elderly face. Loneliness may only be one of these factors. Another confounder may be the obvious urban vs less urban divide, where the most urbanized communities in Toronto would at once contain less private housing options but also higher access rates to mental health spaces. On the other hand, Toronto communities living further away from the urban center may have more private households with people living alone but less access to mental health service. It is well documented that it is urban centers that have greater mental health options in comparison to rural/suburban areas, but since the data is focused completely on an urban area; Toronto, this may not be a reaonable enough confounding variable. As well, the general physical health of individuals in the community can be a confounding variable. Poor physical health can lead to higher rates of living alone (due to factors like separation from caretakers or the inability to live with others) and so higher mental health hospitalization rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limiations of the analysis and sources of error: Perhaps the biggest limitation of my analysis is the way in which the explanatory variable is derived. This analysis aims to explore the relationship between living alone and mental health. The issue is that there is no variable in the Toronto census data that just measures living alone. So my explanatory variable actually measures living alone rates among private households and not the general population. In other words, the x variable in this case does not prescisley evaluate living alone, instead doing so among private households. That means further factors that impact private households may also influence the outcome of the study. Lastly, the study is also cross-sectional, representing mental health data of communities for only a single year. That means, time may also be a sort of confounding variable for this study.  "
